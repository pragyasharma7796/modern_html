HTML Entities:-
The reserved characters used in HTML documents are known as HTM6 entities. They
 are not seen on the typical keyboard. They provide a wide range of characters,
 allowing you to add icons, geometric shapes,mathematical operators, and so on.

HTML entities are useful when you want to display special characters that may 
conflict with HTML syntax or when you want to ensure proper rendering across 
different platforms and browsers that may have different character encoding settings.

It's important to note that with the advancrment of web technologies, they need for 
using HTML entities has diminished to some extent.

Purpose and usage of HTML entities

The main two purposes are:
1. Displaying Special Characters
2. Handling Reserved Characters

1. Displaying Special Characters :HTML entities are used to display characters that
   have special meanings in HTML or characters that cannot be easily typed or 
   displayed directly.
   For example, if you want to display the copyright symbol (©) or the trademark 
   symbol (TM) on a webpage, you would use the corresponding HTML entities &copy;” 
   and &trade;’, respectively.

2. Handling Reserved Characters:  HTML uses certain characters for its syntax and 
   structure, such as the less-than symbol (), the greater-than symbol (>),and the
   ampersand symbol (&). These reserved characters can cause issues if used directly
   in HTML code, as they may be interpreted as part of the markup. 
    By using HTML entities like &lt;, &gt;, and &amp;’, you can display these 
   characters as text on a webpage without affecting the HTML structure.

   The entity code is enclosed in ampersands (&) and semicolons (;) to differentiate 
   it from regular text.
